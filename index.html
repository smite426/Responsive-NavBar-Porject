        <h1>He is here.</h1>
        <p>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?</p>
        <p>Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. I can't get involved! <strong> I've got work to do!</strong> <em> It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now.</em> It's such a long way from here.</p>
        <h2>You mean it controls your actions?</h2>
        <p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. What?! I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</li><li>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</li><li>Don't underestimate the Force.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.</h3>
        <p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? Ye-ha! Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. He is here.</p>
        <ul  id="main">
        <li>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</li><li>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li><li>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Red Five standing by. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</p>
        <p>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</p>
        <p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Don't underestimate the Force. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. What?!</p>
        <p>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. What!? I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
        <p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</p>
        <p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Red Five standing by. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</p>
        <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Ye-ha! What!? Red Five standing by. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</p>
        <p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</p>
        <p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.</p>
        <p>Red Five standing by. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. You don't believe in the Force, do you?</p>
        <p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… What?! What!?</p>
